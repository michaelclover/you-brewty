TODO:

- calculate water loss to:
	- boil (evaporation)
	- hops (during the boil)
	- dead space (if applicable)

- design and create UI for the user to plug all of these values in.

- implement loading and saving of recipe files according to either a pre-defined standard (if one exists) or according to my own standard.

- research about the water to grist ratio and what this influences, and calculate this, advising whether the calculated ratio is sensible or not.

- calculate all of the required water volumes for each step based on the final batch volume, e.g. the initial strike volume (based on a sensible water to grist ratio) and then the required sparge volume etc. Refer to the Grainfather article for help with this.
